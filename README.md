# StabilizingSelection_Introgression

SLiM script for simulations underlying the results in Veller & Simons (2024) "Stabilizing selection generates selection against introgressed DNA"

Folder "LinkageMaps" contains .txt files for male and female linkage maps for humans and Drosophila melanogaster, which the SLiM script reads directly given the option for the variable "map" to equal "Human" or "Dmel" (or "unlinked", in which case the recombination fraction between all pairs of loci is 0.5).
